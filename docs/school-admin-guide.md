## 1. Getting Started

### Who Is This For?

This guide is for **educational administrators** (career services staff, program coordinators, department heads) who manage their institution's presence on Street2Ivy.

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to Street2Ivy at `https://your-domain.street2ivy.com` (or the main Street2Ivy site).
2. Navigate to **Career Services Dashboard** from the top navigation, or go directly to `/education/dashboard`.
3. If you don't see the dashboard link, your account may not have educational admin privileges. See [Requesting Portal Access](#requesting-portal-access).

### Prerequisites

- A verified educational administrator account linked to your institution's domain (e.g., `harvard.edu`).
- Your institution must be registered on Street2Ivy's approved institutions list.
- A tenant portal must be set up (or you can request one — see Section 8).

### Requesting Portal Access

If your institution doesn't yet have a Street2Ivy portal:

1. Log in with your institution email.
2. Navigate to `/education/dashboard`.
3. You'll see a **Request Portal Access** form.
4. Fill in your institution name, your name, contact email, and an optional reason.
5. Click **Submit Request** — our team will review and respond within 2-3 business days.
6. Once approved, you'll receive an email notification and can begin onboarding.

## 2. Dashboard Overview

The dashboard has **six tabs**: Overview, Students, Alumni, Reports, Messages, and Branding.

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a real-time snapshot of your institution's engagement:

| **Registered Students** | Total students from your institution who have created Street2Ivy accounts. "Active" means logged in within the last 30 days. |
| **Project Applications** | Number of project applications submitted by your students. "Pending" applications are still awaiting a company response. |
| **Placements** | Students accepted to work on a corporate project. Acceptance rate = placements / total applications. |
| **Not Selected** | Applications not selected by corporate partners. This is normal — encourage students to apply to multiple projects. |
| **Completed Projects** | Projects students have successfully finished. Completion rate = completed / placed. |

**Engagement Metrics** (secondary row):
- **Invitations Received** — Company invitations sent directly to your students.
- **Companies Engaged** — Unique corporate partners your students have interacted with.
- **Acceptance Rate** — Percentage of applications that resulted in placements.
- **Completion Rate** — Percentage of placed students who completed their projects.

### What Is the Alumni Network?

The Alumni tab lets you invite graduates from your institution to join Street2Ivy as verified alumni. Alumni can:

   - **Graduation Year** (optional) — e.g., "2020"
   - **Program** (optional) — e.g., "Computer Science"
3. Click **Send Invitation**.
4. The alumni receives an email with a unique invitation link.

### Invitation Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Invited** | Email sent, not yet accepted. The alumni hasn't clicked the link yet. |
| **Accepted** | The alumni clicked the link and created their Street2Ivy account. |

### Managing Alumni

## 9. FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why don't I see any students?

Students appear when they register on Street2Ivy using an email matching your institution's domain (e.g., `@harvard.edu`). Share the platform link with your students and encourage them to sign up.

### Q: Can I import student lists in bulk?

Not currently. Students must self-register. We recommend sharing the platform via your career services newsletter, LMS, or student portal.

### Q: An alumni says they didn't receive their invitation email.

1. Check the alumni's status in the Alumni tab.
2. If it shows "Invited", click **Resend** to regenerate the invitation code and send a fresh email.
3. Ask the alumni to check their spam/junk folder.
4. If SMTP is not configured for your deployment, emails are logged to the server console instead of being sent. Contact your system administrator.

### Q: How do I change my portal's branding after launch?

Go to the **Branding** tab and update any field. Click **Save Branding** — changes apply immediately.

### Q: What does "Suspended" portal status mean?

A suspended portal means a system administrator has temporarily disabled your institution's access. Contact Street2Ivy support to resolve.

### Q: Why is the "AI Coaching" toggle grayed out?

AI Coaching requires a subscription. Contact Street2Ivy support to enable it for your institution.

### Q: Can I export data for accreditation reports?

Yes! The **Reports tab** offers CSV exports for institution summaries, student activity, and engagement funnels. These can be imported into any spreadsheet or analytics tool.

### Q: How do I add another administrator for my institution?

Contact Street2Ivy support. Multiple educational administrators can be associated with the same institution domain.

### Q: What happens when I delete an alumni invitation?

The invitation record is removed. If the alumni already accepted and created an account, their user account remains active but is no longer linked to your institution's alumni network.
