## 1. What Is Street2Ivy?

Street2Ivy connects university students with real-world project opportunities at corporate partners. Think of it as a marketplace where companies post mentorship projects and consulting opportunities, and students apply to work on them.

**What you get:**
- Real project experience to build your resume.
- Direct mentorship from industry professionals and alumni.
- A verified record of completed projects.
- Access to companies specifically looking for students from your institution.

## 2. Creating Your Account

### Step 1: Sign Up

1. Go to `https://street2ivy.com/signup/student` (or your institution's branded URL).
2. Choose **Student** as your account type.
3. Enter your **institution email** (e.g., `jane.doe@harvard.edu`).
   - Your email domain is how we verify your institution.
4. Create a strong password.
5. Click **Sign Up**.

### Step 2: Verify Your Email

1. Check your inbox for a verification email from Street2Ivy.
2. Click the verification link.
3. You're verified!

### Waitlist

## 3. Completing Your Profile

A complete profile dramatically increases your chances of being accepted to projects.

### Go to Profile Settings

Navigate to `/profile-settings` or click your avatar > **Profile Settings**.

### What to Include

| Field | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Display Name** | How companies and mentors see you. |
| **Profile Photo** | Projects with photos get 3x more responses. Use a professional headshot. |
| **Bio** | 2-3 sentences about your interests, skills, and what you're looking for. |
| **Major** | Companies filter by major — make sure yours is accurate. |
| **Graduation Year** | Helps companies understand your experience level. |
| **Skills** | List relevant technical and soft skills. |
| **LinkedIn** | Many companies check LinkedIn profiles before accepting applications. |

### Pro Tips

- **Be specific** in your bio: "Marketing major interested in social media strategy for tech startups" is better than "Business student looking for experience."
- **Update regularly** — your profile should reflect your current skills and interests.

## 4. Discovering Projects

### Browse the Marketplace

Go to `/s` (the Search page) to browse available projects.

### Search & Filter

- **Search bar** — Search by keyword, company name, or project type.
- **Listing type** — Filter by category (e.g., consulting, design, engineering, marketing).
- **Location** — Some projects are remote, others on-site.
- **Map view** — See projects geographically (if your institution uses map-based search).

### Institution-Branded Portal

If your institution has a branded portal, you may see a curated view of projects specifically available to students from your school. Your career services team manages this.

### What to Look For

- **Project description** — Read carefully to understand deliverables and expectations.
- **Duration** — Make sure it fits your academic schedule.
- **Company profile** — Click the company name to learn more about them.
- **Requirements** — Check if you meet the stated skills/experience requirements.

## 5. Applying to Projects

### How to Apply

1. Click on a project listing to open the detail page.
2. Review the full description, requirements, and company info.
3. Click **Make Offer** or **Apply** (button text varies by listing type).
4. Write a **cover message** explaining:
   - Why you're interested in this specific project.
   - What relevant skills or experience you bring.
   - Your availability and time commitment.
5. Submit your application.

### Application Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Your application was submitted and is awaiting review. |
| **Accepted** | The company or mentor selected you! Check your inbox for next steps. |
| **Declined** | You weren't selected this time. Keep applying — it's a numbers game. |
| **Completed** | You finished the project successfully. |

### Best Practices

- **Apply to multiple projects** — Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
- **Personalize each application** — Generic messages get ignored.
- **Respond quickly** — If a company messages you, reply within 24 hours.
- **Follow up** — If you haven't heard back in a week, a polite follow-up is fine.

## 6. After You're Accepted

### What Happens Next

1. **Check your inbox** — You'll receive a notification and message from the company/mentor.
2. **NDA signing** (if required) — Some projects require you to sign a non-disclosure agreement. This happens digitally in the project workspace.
3. **Project Workspace access** — You and your mentor get a shared workspace for communication and collaboration.

### Project Workspace

Access your workspace at `/project-workspace/:id` (linked from your inbox/transactions):

- **Messaging** — Communicate directly with your mentor.
- **File sharing** — Exchange documents, deliverables, and references.
- **Progress tracking** — Both parties can see the project status.
- **NDA acceptance** — Sign any required NDAs digitally.

### Completing the Project

When the project is done:

1. Your mentor marks it as complete (or you both confirm completion through the transaction flow).
2. You may receive a **performance assessment** from your mentor.
3. The project appears in your "Completed Projects" on your profile — visible to future employers and mentors.

## 9. FAQ & Tips
