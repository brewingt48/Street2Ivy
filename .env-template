# Heroku / Production Deployment Configuration

#
# M-10: Source Maps
# Set to 'false' to disable source map generation in production builds.
# This reduces build time, bundle size, and prevents exposing source code.
# IMPORTANT: Set this to 'false' on Heroku via: heroku config:set GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false

# M-11: Content Security Policy (CSP)
# Controls how the browser enforces Content Security Policy headers.
# Values:
#   'report' - Violations are reported but not blocked (good for testing)
#   'block'  - Violations are blocked AND reported (recommended for production)
#   (unset)  - CSP is completely disabled (NOT recommended for production)
# IMPORTANT: Set to 'block' on Heroku via: heroku config:set REACT_APP_CSP=block
REACT_APP_CSP=report

# M-15: SSL Redirect
# Forces HTTP requests to redirect to HTTPS. Required for production.
# Set to 'true' when your app is served over HTTPS (e.g., on Heroku).
# IMPORTANT: Set on Heroku via: heroku config:set REACT_APP_SHARETRIBE_USING_SSL=true
REACT_APP_SHARETRIBE_USING_SSL=true

# M-15: Trust Proxy
# Must be set to 'true' when running behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Heroku, AWS ELB).
# This ensures Express correctly reads X-Forwarded-* headers for SSL redirect to work.
# IMPORTANT: Set on Heroku via: heroku config:set SERVER_SHARETRIBE_TRUST_PROXY=true
SERVER_SHARETRIBE_TRUST_PROXY=true

# M-21: Sentry Error Tracking DSN
# Data Source Name for Sentry error monitoring. When set, both the server and
# client will report uncaught exceptions and errors to Sentry.
# Get your DSN from: https://sentry.io/ -> Project Settings -> Client Keys (DSN)
# IMPORTANT: Set on Heroku via: heroku config:set REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id

# This adds data-domains for Plausible script

# Cache configuration for the proxied SDK calls. 0 means no caching.
