# ─── Production Operations Notes ───
#
# BACKUP & RECOVERY:
# - User data, listings, and transactions are stored in Sharetribe Cloud (managed backups).
# - In-memory stores (CSRF tokens, rate-limit counters, audit log cache) are ephemeral
#   and do not survive dyno restarts. This is acceptable for their use case.
# - File uploads via message-attachments use Heroku's ephemeral filesystem and are lost
#   on restart. For persistent file storage, configure an external service (e.g., AWS S3).
# - Environment variables should be backed up separately (e.g., `heroku config -s > .env.backup`).
#
# IMAGE OPTIMIZATION:
# - Listing images are served through Sharetribe's imgix CDN with automatic optimization.
# - Custom-uploaded images (branding, attachments) should be optimized before upload.
# - Consider adding client-side image compression for user uploads (e.g., browser-image-compression).
